export const DESCRIPTION =
  'Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or change the database, but just append the thought to the log. Use it when complex reasoning or some cache memory is needed.'

export const PROMPT = `Use this tool as a whiteboard before doing anything. Think through problems, analyze requirements, plan your approach, or organize your thoughts without taking any actions.

This tool is perfect for:
- Breaking down complex problems into manageable steps
- Analyzing multiple solution approaches before implementation
- Planning your strategy before making changes
- Reasoning through edge cases and potential issues
- Organizing thoughts when dealing with intricate debugging
- Caching important information or context for later reference

Your thoughts will be logged for transparency, but no code will be executed and no files will be changed. Think of it as your mental workspace for complex reasoning.`
