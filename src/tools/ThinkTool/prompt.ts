export const DESCRIPTION =
  'Cognitive processing tool for structured thinking and problem analysis. Documents reasoning processes for enhanced transparency.'

export const PROMPT = `Engage this tool for systematic thinking and analysis. It provides a space for organizing thoughts without executing code or making repository changes, serving as a cognitive workspace for complex reasoning.

Effective applications:
1. Bug analysis - when identifying issues in repositories, use this tool to explore multiple solution approaches and evaluate their effectiveness and simplicity
2. Test failure analysis - after receiving test results, organize different fixing strategies and assess their viability  
3. Architecture planning - when designing complex refactoring, outline various approaches and analyze their trade-offs and implementation complexity
4. Feature design - during new feature development, think through architectural decisions and detailed implementation considerations
5. Complex debugging - when investigating intricate issues, structure hypotheses and reasoning chains for systematic problem-solving

This tool creates a transparent log of your analytical process while maintaining focus on the task without executing changes.`
